The main goal is to create a functional web application "Docu-Agent" with a simple user interface. The user will be able to upload a document in PDF format and then have a conversation with an AI assistant who will answer questions based solely on the content of this document. In addition, the application will be able to extract key information from the text in a structured form on request.
